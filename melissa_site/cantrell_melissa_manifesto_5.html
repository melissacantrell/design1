            <h1> FYI </h1>
            <h2> You're mad. Bonkers. Off your head...But I'll tell you a secret... All of the best people are </h2>


            <p id="one"> Reach for the sky! Believe in yourself. Set high goals and aspire to be the best version of yourself. </p>

            <p id="two"> All it takes is faith and trust...pixie dust helps. But if you are fresh out of pixie dust, always trust your instincts. </p>

            <p id="three"> Remember, you're the one who can fill the world with sunshine. Never doubt yourself or your purpose. Your designs have the ability to make the world a better place. </p>

            <p id="four"> Hakuna Matata. It means no worries. If only that were true. But the fact is, one day everything will be fine and stressing over situations will only make you unhappy and less productive. So let us all relax for a moment, calm ourselves, take a deep breath, and say it loudly with me, Hakuna Matata! </p>

            <p id="five"> Things will look better in the morning. My motto is, when in doubt, go to bed. Our mind and bodies need rest so we can recharge. I read somewhere once that creativity peaks in the morning as the creative connections in our brain are most active. I am sure that is not true for everyone, but if you wake up and things seem to look worse...there's always coffee (or mimosas).  </p>

            <p id="six"> Life is a journey to be experienced, not a problem to be solved. Things can't always be rainbows and sunshine (unless you're Kimmy Schmidt). Everything happens for a reason, and sometimes we have to endure hard times to learn and mature from them.  In the end, the low times make you appreciate the high times even more. </p>

            <p id="seven"> You must be imaginative, strong-hearted. You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you came from. Your only limit is your soul. We can't let what others tell us bring us down because ultimately it is our own will that determines the kind of person we become. </p>

            <p id="eight"> Always let your conscience be your guide. Just be a good person. There are enough bad people in the world. I don't think we need any more them. </p>

            <p id="nine"> In every job that must be done there is an element of fun. Making your design process fun and interesting means no two days are ever the same. What's the point of working in the creative industry if you aren't having fun. </p>

            <p id="ten"> Giving up is for rookies. Always persevere! Don't ever quit or give up!  </p>

            <p id="eleven"> A dream is a wish your heart makes. Dreams are what drives us forward. Have faith in the future. </p>

            <p id="twelve"> Nothing's Impossible. All you have to do is begin and see where it takes you. Bob Ross said it best, we don't make mistakes - we just have happy accidents.  </p>

            <p id="thirteen"> If watching is all you're gonna do, then you're gonna watch your life go by without ya. Take initiative, be a part of life, and not just a spectator, live life to the fullest. </p>

            <p id="fourteen"> Good friends will help you until you're unstuck. Each designer brings something unique to the table and everyone tries to solve the same problems differently. When these solutions are combined, imagine the possibilities! </p>

            <p id="fifteen"> If everybody got somebody by the hand, maybe everyone could learn to love and understand. </p>
